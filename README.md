# portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website that I have made using HTML and CSS only.

It's a simple and static portfolio but, responsive itself.
The main reason to make this porfolio was to practice CSS animation, transition, and media query along side to showcasing my project and skills.

This won't be my Primary portfolio, it will be with React JS. It's my temporary Portfolio to showcase.
